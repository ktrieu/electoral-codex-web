# Electoral Codex

Now live at http://electoral-codex.openode.io

A website to visualize elections data from my other repository, [Electoral Codex.](https://github.com/ktrieu/electoral-codex)
Highlights include an interactive map for for every polling division in every election from 2004-2015, and some more detailed graphics using D3.

# Instructions:
Before starting, you'll need the database files. Download from [the releases section](https://github.com/ktrieu/electoral-codex/releases) of the repository above.
From there it's a simple `node app.js`. The server will run on port 3000.
